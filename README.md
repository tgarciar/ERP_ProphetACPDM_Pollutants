# ERP: Prophet ACPDM for detecting changes in Pollutants Behaviour
Anextended research project (ERP) report submitted to the University of Manchester

Title: Assessing Prophet automated change point detection method ability to recognise NOx, PM2.5 and O3 fluctuations produced by COVID-19 lockdown policies

Ob1: Evaluate Prophet's ACPDM proficiency to recognise changes in the behaviour of NOx, PM2.5, and O3 pollutants in Manchester. due to UK lockdown policies during 2020-2021.

Ob2: Compare various techniques for change point detection within Prophet's ACPDM and provide recommendations for their application in air quality monitoring.

Ob3:Examine different strategies for weather normalisation of air quality data and their impact on trend change point analyses.
